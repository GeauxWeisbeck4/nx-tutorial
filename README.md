# NX Tutorial

I am attempting to try out NX for the very first time (kinda) on StackBlitz. The other time I've used it was with Next.js, a framework I am much more familiar with than Angular. But I bet it will still be rockin and we'll have some fun! Let's ring in the New Years with some Stackblitz fun and New Frameworks for the New Year!

## To Try this Out
